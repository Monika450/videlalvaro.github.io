Back when I was in Shanghai I saw one of our chinese colleagues to be able to work really fast on the command line. By really fast I don't mean fast typing but fast edition of commands. He could jump around his cursor over the line and move words here and there with ease. Perhaps you are an advanced CLI user but in my case I've got really impressed by that. Of course I asked what was his *secret*. **Emacs** he said, plain and old Emacs.

Back when I was in Shanghai I saw one of our chinese colleagues to be able to work really fast on the command line. By really fast I don't mean fast typing but fast edition of commands. He could jump around his cursor over the line and move words here and there with ease. Perhaps you are an advanced CLI user but in my case I've got really impressed by that. Of course I asked what was his *secret*. **Emacs** he said, plain and old Emacs.

So what does Emacs has to do with all this speed? The _key_ is in the key bindings that you have to use while editing with Emacs. After I learned some of them I also found out that most applications also support them. Yes even your browser supports the Emacs key bindings. Not that I'm discovering powder but yes, for me most of this was new.

In this post I want to show you how to edit the text that you entered on the CLI, how to move text around, copy paste it and so on all by using default keyboard shortcuts. Some of this keyboard shortcuts should work on your Terminal and in some of your other applications like Mail or Safari as well. Keep in mind that I've only tested this on my Mac using the default shell.

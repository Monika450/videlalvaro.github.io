In this article I want to explore the relation between the process of
writing computer programs with that of writing literary works of
fiction. I want to see what parallels can we trace from the ideas
presented by Umberto Eco in *Lector in Fabula* and *Six Walks in the
Fictional Woods*, with the way we write programs today.

The goal of this article is to ask--and try to answer--the following
questions: what can we learn as programmers from literary theory? What
ideas can we incorporate from that discipline into our day to day
programming activities, so we write code that's easier to understand for
other humans (or our future selves)?
    
## Programming as a Humans-First Activity ##

The need for computer programs that are easier to understand for humans
is not a new one. Since the early '50s as programmers started to
distance themselves from machine code and began to program in higher
level languages, we began to see a need to write code that appeals not
only to machines but to humans as well. When David
Wheeler [25] introduced the idea of the subroutine to the
programming world, he said that:

> sub-routines are very useful--although not absolutely necessary--and
> that the prime objectives to be born in mind when constructing them
> are simplicity of use, correctness of codes and accuracy of
> description.

So we see that *subroutines* are not necessary for a program to work,
but they are a device that can help with program understanding among
other things.

Almost a decade later an anonymous article was published in the
Datamation magazine called *What A Programmer Does* [3], which
is surprising for how relatable those ideas are today. Its author is
also concerned with the way humans communicate knowledge to each other,
in the forms of programs. The money quote is this one:

> A programmer does not primarily write code; rather, he primarily
> writes to another programmer about his problem solution.

Later they reaffirm their point by saying:

> Both the value and quality of a programmer's work improve directly
> with the importance he places on communicating his program to a human,
> rather than merely to the machine.

We could say that this sentiment is finally echoed in its most popular
form in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
(SICP) [2] when their authors say:

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
> machines to execute.

That is a strong statement, elevating humans as the main recipients of
computer programs. Computers becoming mere tools that are able to run
those programs at a speed that's useful for our practical purposes.

These ideas, presented by programmers for programmers, contrast with the
ways programs are being seen by the industry and by the public in
general. That is to say, we program because we expect results from the
programs we produce. Whether it's accounting, or finding the route to
hour hotel in a foreign city, most consumers of programs use them
because of the results they produce. In fact, we could argue that a user
will be quite displeased if they find themselves lost after following
the routes offered by their GPS, even if customer support arguments that
the code for their GPS software looks really pretty. We could say that
this practicality has placed more emphasis in the results produced by
programs than in how well they read for other people. When the goal is
to meet a client's deadline, then the results produced by a program,
it's *visible output*, is what matters (unless in cases where we are
selling the software itself, where the end consumers will be other
programmers).

This last point shows us that if we want to advocate for writing
programs that other programmers can understand, then we need to
understand that we need to accommodate these ideas in the software
industry, an industry where the results produced by the programs is in
constant tension with the quality in which those programs are produced,
usually due to budget requirements. If we want to advocate for programs
that are easier to understand, we need not forget that while programmers
might want that as well, there are other forces at play that may compel
programmers to declare their programs to be ready for delivery as soon
as they produce the expected outputs, rather than investing time in
tasks like refactoring. I said *expected outputs* because talking about
*correct outputs* would be the topic of a complete different discussion.
Having said that, the rest of this article assumes that we share the
preoccupation of the authors of *SICP*, of the anonymous author of *What
A Programmer Does*, and that of David Wheeler, among others. Who else
was interested in these ideas? Donald Knuth.

## Literate Programming ##

In Literate Programming Donald Knuth [18] wrote about the
attitude we should have when we write programs: "instead of imagining
that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer
to do". He goes on in his paper explaining the WEB system for writing
software documentation, which we could say has been partially adopted by
the industry in tools like Java Docs and the like.

So while we have systems that can help us write documentation, we still
have the problem of how to effectively transfer our tacit knowledge
about the system to other programmers. Literate Programming is a good
step towards placing emphasis on documentation and communication, but
still doesn't explain how we could accomplish that goal. It's
interesting at least that he points at literature as a place where we
could learn techniques for writing programs that are easier to
understand for other humans.

Here we need to address a difference between writing (as in literature),
and programming that's been raised by papers like *Programming is
Writing is Programming* by Herman and Aldewereld [16]. There
they say:

> a difference between writing and programming, \[is that\] in
> programming, the programmer gets feedback very early on whether the
> program text is executable, during compiling. Furthermore, they get
> feedback on whether the program is working as intended.

One could argue that while this is true, knowing that a program is
working as intended doesn't indicate that we know what the program
actually means, that is, what process from the real world is trying to
represent, what problem is trying to solve, neither is telling us how
said problem has been solved.

We could compare this with playing music on a guitar by reading the
notes as they appear on a staff. In the guitar an `E5` could be played
on the 12th fret on the 6th string, on the 7th fret on the 5th string
and on the 2nd fret on the 4th string. Since all these finger positions
produce the same sound, we could say the music was executed as written
in the staff, but this is not sufficient to consider it correct playing.
As Carlevaro explains in his *Serie DidÃ¡ctica para
Guitarra* [6]:

> Correct guitar playing is unconceivable without correct fingering.

So it's not only is important the result produced by a function, or the
musical note emitted by an instrument, but also it's important how these
results were produced.

As Knuth writes in The Art of Computer Programming [19], is a
`random` function that returns the number `2` as result, a valid
implementation? Equally we could ask: is a `square` function that
returns `25` a correct implementation? As long as the input values for
the `square` function happen to be `5` or `-5`, then the implementation
appears to be correct.

While this example might sound like a stretch, TDD [4] advocates
to start writing stub functions that behave exactly like this, providing
the minimum implementation that could yield a correct result for a
particular test. This kinds of testing presents the problem of needing
to submit a program to every kind of possible input to show that it
works as expected. In the words of Dijkstra [9]:

> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to
> show their absence!.

Tools like QuickCheck [7] try to alleviate this problem by
generating random input for tests, while at the same time presenting
techniques like *Property Based Testing*. So while we are creating
better tools to prove the correctness of programs, we are still left to
our own means when it comes to understanding what a program is doing.

Does this means we should consider every program as a *work of
literature* like Knuth says in his paper? In Cybertext: Perspectives on
Ergodic Literature, Espen J. Aarseth presents a different point of
view [1]:

> \[\...\] a search for literary value in texts that are neither
> intended nor structured as literature will only obscure the unique
> aspects of these texts and transform a formal investigation into an
> apologetic crusade.

I concur with Aarseth. Trying to find literary value in programs seems
to be a task destined to fail, because programs aren't written with a
literary goal. That doesn't mean there isn't any value in thinking of
programs as literature. I think there is, but in a different way. We
should look at literature and learn from the techniques authors use when
writing fictional works. This means we should go to the Humanities side
of the building and learn from Literature Theory, Linguistics and
Semiotics and incorporate some of their techniques into our day to day
activities as programmers.

## Knowledge sharing ##

Before we delve into the various ideas from Literary Theory that could
help us improve the way we write our programs to we share knowledge
between programmers, we need to ask ourselves *what* kind of knowledge
are we trying to share. What is this *meaning* that programs should
convey and that me as a programmer reading a certain piece of code
should be able to understand.

In *Programming as Theory Building* Peter Naur [20] draws our
attention towards the idea of a *Theory* based on Gilbert Ryle's *The
Concept of Mind* [21]. Naur explains the knowledge a software
engineer builds about a system in the following terms:

> \[\...\] a person who has or possesses a theory in this sense knows
> how to do certain things and in addition can support the actual doing
> with explanations, justifications, and answers to queries, about the
> activity of concern.

and he continues:

> \[\...\]what has to be built by the programmer is a theory of how
> certain affairs of the world will be handled by, or supported by, a
> computer program.

So from the moment we do requirements gathering, to how we implement
those requirements in code, we are building a theory that tacitly
includes the different tradeoffs we took along the way. For example: why
are we using `Long` instead of `Integer` for the numbers we use in
certain class; why the time resolutions is in nanoseconds and not
milliseconds; why we added a caching layer to avoid network roundtrips;
why we decided to implement our own library for problem X instead of
using what was available on the market; why our key value data structure
is backed by a tree instead of an array; why we decided to not add a
layer of abstraction between the database and its query language; and so
on. Of course the list is not exhaustive. Some answers to those
questions might be clearly obtained by reading the code, like for
example: let's say there's just one SQL query in the whole project. So
we could argue there was no need for a library that abstracted the
database away.

In this article we are interested about those instances where knowledge
cannot be immediately obtained from the source code, its tests and
documentation, or any of the other artifacts produced by the code. There
is where we want to go and look for help in Literary Theory,
Linguistics, and related disciplines, so we see how we could improve the
way we write software.

When we try to read code written by other programmers or by a past
version of ourselves, we are presented with the task of reverse
engineering that code. We start by trying to understand what the
original programmers tried to solve with that program. It doesn't matter
if this is legacy code or if we just landed on a team and we are handed
with the next issue on the bug tracker. We will be faced with some code
and we will have to read it and understand it so we can proceed with the
confidence that we are modifying it in the right way, or adding the new
feature in the right place, so we solve the problem at hand.

The problem with this approach is that it places the burden of
understanding the code in the reader. The reader has to be able to
decipher the code, but the difference with cryptography is that we are
not adversaries, but members of the same team, so understanding code
shouldn't be a challenge, but a matter of collaboration.

Imagine if every time we tried to read a book, we had to play code
breakers? Unless we were reading the Finnegans Wake, I'm sure that
wouldn't be a enjoyable reading experience. In the case of programming,
unless we have are in the business of reverse engineering code, then we
shouldn't have the need to play Finnegans Wake every time we are faced
for the first time with a program.

So what can we do as programmers to help others understand our code?

## The Encyclopedia ##

In *Lector in Fabula* [13] and *Six Walks in the Fictional
Woods* [11] Eco introduces the idea of the *Encyclopedia*, which
comprises all the knowledge in the world. It's safe to assume that no
human posses that knowledge. We have our own limited *encyclopedias* (in
lowercase). Whenever we try to interpret a text we bring our own
encyclopedia into the game and we rebuild its contents, we actualize it
according to our own competence. Consider this very short story:

> I sat in front of my computer and started coding.

When we read a text like in the previous example, we make a lot of
choices when it comes to actualize that text. If we imagine the
programmer typing their program on a laptop or a on a keyboard connected
to a computer, it doesn't matter, unless the device used is
consequential to the rest of the story. I'm used to write programs on a
laptop, so most probably I will image that scene with a person typing
their program on that kind of computer. What's the programmer's gender?
Are their blond or have dark hair? For some readers that doesn't matter,
so they don't even think about that, while other people might render
them according to their own preferences or biases. The lesson to take
home from this, is that *we fill in the blanks on a story using what's
available on our own encyclopedia*. This opens a very interesting
question of how we as authors manage to transfer our ideas from our
minds to our communication recipients or *destinataries*. If we fail at
that, the other person might end up building a different interpretation
of what the code does.

A key idea from *Lector in Fabula* is Eco's criticism of communication
theory, he says:

> \[\...\] the competence of the recipient is not necessarily that of
> the sender.

and later he adds:

> Therefore, in order to "decode" a verbal message, in addition to
> linguistic competence, a differently circumstantial competence, an
> ability to trigger presuppositions, to repress idiosyncrasies, etc.,
> and so on.

So how do we go about understanding the *target audience* for our
programs? Eco has an answer for that as well, the *Model Reader*.

## The Model Reader ##

The *Model Reader* is not the empirical reader (not you, or me). It's a
reader that lives in the mind of the author, which the author builds as
they write their story. This model reader will help the author decide
how much detail is required in their work, so the empirical readers are
able to understand it. Let's go back to our one sentence story:

> I sat in front of my computer and started coding.

In that text I've made some choices about how much info I wanted to
convey based on my Model Reader; in this case I assumed that I don't
need to explain that I'm using a keyboard to type the program, because
in most cases, that's how it's done. In that one sentence story, my
Model Reader is a person that's familiar with how computers work, and
with how we type programs in a computer today.

To show how important the model reader is, let's imagine we see a sign
at the London Underground system that says: *dogs must be carried on
escalator*. In *Literary Theory: an Introduction* [10], Terry
Eagleton, asks the following question about that simple sentence:

-   Does it mean that you must carry a dog in the escalator?

-   Are you going to be banned from the escalator unless you find a
    stray dog to carry?

-   "Carried" is to be taken metaphorically and help dogs get through
    life?

-   How do I know this is not a decoration?

-   I need to understand that the sign has been placed there by some
    authority Conventions: I understand that "escalator" means this
    escalator and not some escalator in Paraguay.

-   "Must be" means must be now.

So we see that such a simple sentence like "dogs must be carried on
escalator", implies a Model Reader that understands that if they are
using the London Underground system, and they bring a dog, the must
carry that dog if they have to use an escalator. All that information,
while not provided in the text, was implied when the designers of the
sign chose their Model Reader.

So one aspect of the idea of the Model Reader revolves around how much
information or context do we provide in the text, so the message we are
trying to convey is understandable. Another aspect is that, as the story
progresses the author also builds the Model Reader.

Now let's imagine my previous text went as follows:"I sat in front of my
computer and started coding. The clouds outside my window had cleared,
revealing the Mars landscape." Once the word *Mars* appears in the text,
we can easily tell that what seemed to be a personal recollection (about
me typing into a computer), turned out to be a science fiction story
about space exploration. With that small clue (Mars) the author built a
Model Reader that must accept that the story is fictional, since so far
we don't have humans living in Mars.

In *Lector in Fabula*, Eco goes deeper into the idea of the Model Reader
(and the Model Author), to present the concept of textual cooperation.
There he says:

> A text is a lazy (or economic) mechanism that lives on the surplus
> value of meaning introduced by the recipient \[\...\]

Reading is essentially a work of cooperation between the author and the
reader.

To summarize, the author uses a Model Reader in order to decide how to
tell the story, both in how much detail they need to provide, and on how
to give clues to tell the reader this is a noir novel, or this is epic
fantasy, or everything that was said so far *was part of a dream so be
careful if you keep reading, since what comes next might still be part
of a dream*. The Model Reader is someone that's willing to cooperate
with the author. The Model Reader actualizes the text.

The question is how does the concept of the Model Reader can help us
think about how we write programs? Who is our Model Reader? Is it the
computer? Is it another human, or a future me?

## A Programmer's Model Reader ##

As I wrote in the introduction to this article, a striking difference
between writing programs and writing literature is that most of the time
programs are written for computers to execute, not for humans to find
the development of plots and storylines like one would expect from a
work of fiction. As we already argued in this article, when we are
writing software we are trying to satisfy some very practical needs,
trying to address some human problem. So how can we integrate these two
seemingly opposing points of view?

We can try to answer that question by pondering who is the Model Reader
when we write programs? Who do we keep in mind while we type our code?
The first answer that comes to mind is the compiler. We write code
trying to follow all the syntactical rules of a specific programming
language, while providing all the necessary clues for it to find the
definitions of the functions and types used in the program. We can say
that when we program "we play computer" in our heads. Since today almost
nobody writes code for a specific computer architecture, we can say that
we build a model computer in our minds, and then we try to second guess
how it will run our code based on our assumptions about that ideal
computer. So our Model Reader fluctuates between trying to satisfy a
compiler and an imaginary computer.

## A Cooperation Game ##

The idea of playing computer in our heads is interesting because it
relates to Eco's idea of producing text as a game of strategy. To win in
a game of strategy we build a model opponent and use that model to try
to anticipate their moves, so we can put in place a strategy that help
us win the game. Eco says that in a way at Waterloo, Wellington built a
more accurate model of Napoleon.

Let's forget about fighting and let's think in terms of cooperation,
let's think on how we build strategies that can help the recipients of
the text actualize it. In the words of Eco:

> A text wants someone to help it work.

How can we help a computer/compiler to actualize a text, so it's able to
bring the code to life, in the same way we do when we read fiction?
Borrowing from literature we can say we do world building when we
declare types, or when we define interfaces in header files. Later we
tell the compiler where to find the headers that define the interfaces
used in our programs. Whenever we use names, like variables, we usually
have to declare them first. In strong-typed languages, we even assign
types to those variables, which help us reason about those programs, but
also give clues to the compiler about what to do whenever they find
those datatypes further down in the program. So on one hand a variable
name, or its type, appeals to the reader to access their encyclopedia to
try to understand what that variable represents, on the other hand, when
we define those variables, or specify their types, we are building said
reader as the text is built.

Still, we keep seeing this duplicity of writing for the computer, and
writing for a human reader. Again, Espen Aarseth raises an interesting
point in his book about cybertext:

> Programs are normally written with two kinds of receivers in mind: the
> machines and other programmers. This gives rise to a double standard
> of aesthetics, often in conflict: efficiency and clarity.

This poses an interesting question, which can be related to Eco's idea
of the different levels of readers.

## Different Levels of Readers ##

In the essay *Intertextual Irony and Levels of Reading* [12],
Umberto Eco writes that texts that have an aesthetic aim tend to
construct several levels of Model Readers. In the first level, the
reader just wishes to finish the story, to know what happens, to know
how it ends. The second level reader is a semiotic or aesthetic reader,
who wants to know how what happens has been narrated. To become a second
level reader, one has to read a story many times.

I want to posit that we humans are the second level readers of our
programs. We are the ones that want to know how what happens in the code
has been narrated.

The question is then how do we manage to interpret a text, and add
meaning to it, understanding its intended goal? And how we as
authors/programmers can help others understand our code? Let's talk
about metaphors.

## Metaphors ##

In *Metaphors We Compute By* [24] I wrote that code is a
metaphor for a solution we found. A program is a translation into code
of that problem solution. The explanatory power of that code, how well
the solution is transmitted, is the measure of its elegance.

I will not repeat the whole argument presented in that article, but the
gist of it is that if we have a collection of elements that need to be
unique, a `Set` data structure has more explanatory power than an
`Array`, even tho an `Array` would fit the job just fine, because the
`Set` implies element uniqueness. A second point is the power metaphors
have for obscuring and augmenting our knowledge. In *Epidemic algorithms
for replicated database maintenance* Demers et al. [8] explain
how *gossip* was a good metaphor for understanding the replication
technique they were proposing, but it wasn't until they come to the
realization that it mapped quite well to the idea of *epidemics* and how
they spread in a population. This realization helped them wield all the
mathematical theory behind the prevention of epidemics' spread.

As Peter GÃ¤rdenfors says in *Geometry of Meaning: Semantics Based on
Conceptual Spaces* [15]:

> Metaphorical mappings preserve the the cognitive topology of the
> source domain in a way consistent with the inherent structure of the
> target domain. Metaphors transfer information from one conceptual
> domain to another. What is transferred is a pattern rather than domain
> specific information. A metaphor can thus be used to identify a
> structure in a domain that would not have been discovered otherwise.

So metaphors help with understanding, which means we could leverage
their power when choosing the abstractions we use in our code. The
understanding of who the Model Readers of our code are, will serve as
guide when needing to choose the right metaphor. For example if we
implement the exponentiation algorithm presented in section 1.2.4 of
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs [2], should
we do it by allowing our function to just accept `integers`, or should
we go for an abstraction like `Monoids` so the code would work for other
data types that provide an associative binary operation and identity,
like `Strings` and concatenation, or a `Matrix` and exponentiation? (See
*Elements of Programming* by [23] for a discussion on how to
evolve the exponentiation algorithm for from Integers to Monoids).

What other tool could we bring from literature that could help us write
programs that are easier to understand? Enter paratexts.

## Paratexts ##

In literature there's the idea of the *Paratext*, which Eco quoting
GÃ©rard Genette defines as:

> \[\...\] the "paratext" consists of the whole series of messages that
> accompany and help explain a given text--messages such as
> advertisements, jacket copy, title, subtitles, introduction, reviews,
> and so on.

Genette adds the following to his definition of paratext[14]:

> \[a paratext is\] a privileged place of a pragmatics and a strategy,
> of an influence on the public, an influence that--whether well or
> poorly understood and achieved--is at the service of a better
> reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it.

An obvious instance of paratexts in literature could be found in old
books, like Don Quixote, where chapter titles are followed by text like
this:

> Chapter I. Which treats of the character and pursuits of the famous
> gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.

Do we have these kinds of paratext in code? Yes, as said earlier, we not
only specify imports, we arrange the code in modules, packages and
libraries. We specify flags for the compiler that can change the way the
software is built (for example changing a library's location). In
languages like Haskell we could add pragmas to the source code that
could change the meaning of the program or even its efficiency. This
means that as we write code, we are not only targeting our model
computer, we are also targeting a specific compiler. We are trying to
provide it with information so it's able to understand what it should do
when it finds code stating that the variable `isActive` is of the type
`AtomicBoolean`.

We also need to consider how paratexts helps us humans understand
programs. When we read `utils` as part of a package name we build a
different set of expectations about the contents of that package from
when we read `network`, or `persistence`. A class name like `FileSystem`
is telling us a lot of things about what to expect in its API. Finding a
public method called `stringCompare` inside it will feel very strange.
Code comments are probably one of the most important paratexts that can
help other programmers understand our code. Keeping them in sync with
the code is a whole different problem. Not even Cervantes escaped this
fate: in Don Quixote, the original description for Chapter X doesn't
match the contents of the chapter!

To understand how important paratexts are, consider what Genette says
about them:

> To indicate what is at stake, we can ask one simple question as an
> example: limited to the text alone and without a guiding set of
> directions, how would we read Joyce's Ulysses if it were not entitled
> Ulysses?

Let's try to visualize this with a simple code example. Consider the
following class representing a user:

    class User {
        String username;
        String password;
        String role;
        
        User(String username, String password, String role) {
            this.username = username;
            this.password = password;
            this.role     = role;
        }
        
        public String getUsername() {return username;}
        public String getPassword() {return password;}
        public String getRole()     {return role;}
    }

The code of this class doesn't offer enough information to tell us what
is the class purpose. Now let's consider the following test case:

    User user = new User('alice', 'secret', 'admin');
    assertEquals(user.getUsername(), 'alice');
    assertEquals(user.getPassword(), 'secret');
    assertEquals(user.getRole(), 'admin');

The previous test can give us feedback about the code working as
expected, but we are still in the dark about what is this class purpose,
that is, what concept of the real world this class is trying to
represent.

Now let's see the following class:

    package database;

    class User {
        String username;
        String password;
        String role;
        
        User(String username, String password, String role) {
            this.username = username;
            this.password = password;
            this.role     = role;
        }
        
        public String getUsername() {return username;}
        public String getPassword() {return password;}
        public String getRole()     {return role;}
    }

The only difference with the previous code is the line saying
`package database`.

The mere fact that we include a paratext telling us which package this
class belongs to, tells us immediately that this class serves a
different purpose from another `User` class that could appear inside the
`model` package. The latter could represent a `User` in the system, say
our social network website, which has different roles, like *paying
member*, while the database `User` class could offer roles like `admin`,
`app_read` or `app_write`, for example. In a language without packages,
the same information could be conveyed via the project's folder
structure.

On a funnier note, what would Magritte think of the following code?

    // This is not a person
    class Person {
        String name;
        String age;
        
        User(String name, String age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age  = age;
        }
        
        public String getName() {return name;}
        public String getAge()  {return age;}
    }

So while it's dubious that someone will think the previous class
encompasses the whole definition of a person, how many of us have spent
hours debugging a `FileSystem` class that doesn't live up to its API's
promises, because ultimately we didn't realize that this class *is not*
the File System? So that comment about the class not being a person,
even if funny, can lead us to interesting semiotical questions about the
realities represented by our code.

## Conclusion ##

The last point brings us back to metaphors, maps, and ultimately how we
see the world. Espen Aarseth writes:

Earlier I said that a program is a metaphor for a solution we found. A
map between reality and the world of data structures and algorithms.
Code is a kind of visualization for a particular problem. Visualizations
are made with certain goals and certain audiences in mind. This is what
Noah Iliinsky has to say about maps in the book *Beautiful
Visualization* [22], when he describes the style of the London
Tube's Map, a map that detached itself from a mere geographical
representation of the underground lines:

> That freed the map of any attachment to accurate representation of
> geography and led to an abstracted visual style that more simply
> reflected the realities of subway travel: once you're in the system,
> what matters most is your logical relationship to the rest of the
> subway system.

Then Iliinsky writes about what makes for an effective visualization:

> The first area to consider is what knowledge you're trying to convey,
> what question you're trying to answer, or what story you're trying to
> tell.
>
> \[\...\] the next consideration is how the visualization is going to
> be used. The readers and their needs, jargon, and biases must all be
> considered.
>
> The readers' specific knowledge needs may not be well understood
> initially, but this is still a critical factor to bear in mind during
> the design process.
>
> If you cannot, eventually, express your goal concisely in terms of
> your readers and their needs, you don't have a target to aim for and
> have no way to gauge your success.
>
> "Our goal is to provide a view of the London subway system that allows
> riders to easily determine routes between stations,"
>
> Understanding the goals of the visualization will allow you to
> effectively select which facets of the data to include and which are
> not useful or, worse, are distracting.

His points resonate with the ideas of choosing a Model Reader, where we
ask ourselves what elements from our encyclopedia we need to share, and
which ones could be readily actualized by the recipients of our texts.
We also must write code with certain goals in mind, not only thinking
about what our final users will be able to do with the product, but also
thinking about what we will allow other programs to perform with the
APIs we expose. How good is the *theory* we build about the problem we
are solving, will determine the usability our maps--our code--will end
up having. Because in the end, with abstractions--whether they are
types, classes or interfaces--we are designing maps.

As William Kent says in *Data and Reality: a Timeless Perspective on
Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise World* [17]:

> After a while it dawned on me that these are all just maps, being poor
> artificial approximations of some real underlying terrain.

and he adds:

> What is the territory really like? How can I describe it to you? Any
> description I give you is just another map.

The *theory* we built about our software, with its implicit decisions
and tradeoffs, will be effectively shared by choosing the right
*metaphors* that will resonate with our reader's *encyclopedias*. These
metaphors will work like maps that guide understanding. We will also
count with the help of *paratexts*. These paratexts will work like sign
posts on a country road, so when the map is not good enough, our users
will still be able to orient themselves. Because ultimately we need to
understand what Borges so clearly illustrates in his short story *On
Exactitude in Science* [5], and that is: **the map is not the
territory**.
